Scripts to create Envoy3.1 Installation Directory

What is Envoy?

Envoy is a networking suite for the Commodore Amiga.  It provides peer-to-peer
networking capabilities for Amiga computers with bundled support for file and
printer sharing.


Originally published by Commodore, the final commercial version was 
Envoy 3.0 published by Schatztruhe.  The last update was Envoy 3.1.

Why these scripts?

Envoy is no longer available commercially, but I'm unsure of who has the 
rights.  The only publicly available version is a floppy version of Envoy 3.0
released by the cracking group Faith in 1998.

This version is available on TOSEC, but the installation scripts are broken.

Additionally, the update for Envoy 3.1, which is available on Aminet, does
not play nice with the cracked Envoy 3.0 version available.

What do these scripts do?

These scripts take files from available sources and create a working Envoy 3.0
installation drawer.

Additionally, a new install script is included that works!

What are the pre-requisites?

1.  A copy of LHa installed in your Amiga's path
2.  A copy of the update archive from Aminet
3.  A copy of the Envoy disks from TOSEC
